The first thing you'll see when you launch Clojure Box is the read-eval-print
loop (REPL). Start typing Clojure expressions and you're on your way!

If you're new to Emacs, check out the built in tutorial by typing C-h t
(Control+h and then t). Here are some of the most useful commands to get you
started:

Open a file (find-file is the Emacs function): C-x C-f
Save a file (save-buffer): C-x C-s
Switch to another open buffer (iswitchb): C-x b
Close Emacs (kill-emacs): C-x C-c
Execute any Emacs function by name: M-x (Alt+x)

In the REPL you can use M-p and M-n to cycle up and down across previous
expressions.

To make your own jar files available to Clojure's import function, put them in
the ~/.clojure directory. ~ is the application data directory under your user
profile, unless you have set the HOME environment variable. (You'll have to
restart the REPL to make new jars available if you've just dropped them in.)
