The first thing you'll see when you launch Clojure Box is the read-eval-print
loop (REPL). Start typing Clojure expressions and you're on your way!

If you're new to Emacs, check out the built in tutorial by typing C-h t
(Control+h and then t). Here are some of the most useful commands to get you
started:

Open a file (find-file is the Emacs function): C-x C-f
Save a file (save-buffer): C-x C-s
Switch to another open buffer (iswitchb): C-x b
Close Emacs (kill-emacs): C-x C-c
Execute any Emacs function by name: M-x (Alt+x)
Restart the REPL with src, classes, and lib/*.jar on the classpath: M-x
swank-clojure-project

In the REPL you can use M-p and M-n to cycle up and down across previous
expressions.
